Simple RSS Reader is an open source web app for simply reading RSS feeds. 
 
 I have create a very basic RSS-reader using Ruby on Rail, Bootstrap  to do following tasks:
    Interface to add/remove/edit Feed URLS.
    List all feeds. Fetch RSS feed titles automatically.
    A reader page – fetch latest posts from all feeds and combine them together. 
    Sort by date – most recent first and then display.
    Display title only. Clicking on title will open original article page in new tab/window."
